# Choose Your Own JavaScript

### Introduction

Remember when we made our own [choose your own adventure story](https://github.com/abbreviatedman/the-adventures-of-link)? We'll be doing that again, but we'll use JavaScript so that they can directly type in their answers instead of clicking links.


### Basic Setup

Start with index.html. You'll see that we have a prompt and a user input box.

Now open main.js. You'll see a function that runs when they submit their input, and a variable that holds that input. From there, we have a simple `if` statement that tells the page to switch to a different html file. This `if` statement, what it checks, and where it goes in different circumstances, are what you'll want to change.


### Guidelines

You'll have to make at least 15 pages, and of the things you check in your `if` statements, they should include:
* At least one number-related check
* At least one check that two things are both true.
* At least one check that _at least_ one thing is true.
* At least one check that something is NOT true.


### Tools You Might Want to Use

* `if`
* `else`
* `===`
* `.includes()`
* `.toLowerCase()`
* `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
* `!==`
